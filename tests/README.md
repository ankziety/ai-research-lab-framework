# Tests

The `tests` directory will include unit tests and integration tests for the various components of the AI Research Lab framework. Each module should have corresponding test files here to ensure correctness and maintainability. We will use open-source testing frameworks appropriate to the language and context (e.g., pytest for Python modules).
