# Memory

This directory contains implementations for the framework's memory subsystem. The initial version uses FAISS for vector similarity search combined with a SQLite stub to persist metadata. Modules in this folder will provide APIs to store and retrieve embeddings from the vector store, manage collection schemas, and handle persistence.
