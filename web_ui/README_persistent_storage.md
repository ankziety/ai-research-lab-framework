# Persistent Storage Implementation

## Overview

The AI Research Lab web interface now supports true persistent storage instead of just backup functionality. All data is automatically saved to a local SQLite database and persists across app restarts.

## Features

### Real-time Data Persistence
- **Chat Logs**: All messages, thoughts, and communications are saved immediately
- **Agent Activity**: Agent actions, status changes, and activities are persisted
- **Meetings**: Meeting records, transcripts, and outcomes are stored
- **Sessions**: Research sessions with their configuration and results
- **Metrics**: System performance metrics and session statistics

### Session Continuity
- Sessions continue from where they left off when the app is restarted
- Active sessions are preserved and can be resumed
- Historical data is loaded automatically on app startup

### Data Retrieval
- All historical data is available through the web interface
- Session history shows previous research sessions
- Chat logs and agent activity are searchable and filterable
- Meeting records are preserved with full details

## Database Schema

The persistent storage uses SQLite with the following tables:

### Sessions Table
- `id`: Unique session identifier
- `created_at`: Session creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp
- `status`: Session status (pending, running, completed, failed, stopped)
- `research_question`: The research question being investigated
- `config`: Session configuration (JSON)
- `results`: Research results (JSON)
- `metadata`: Additional session metadata (JSON)

### Chat Logs Table
- `session_id`: Reference to session
- `log_type`: Type of log entry (thought, choice, communication, tool_call, system)
- `author`: Author of the message
- `message`: The actual message content
- `timestamp`: When the message was created
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (JSON)

### Agent Activity Table
- `session_id`: Reference to session
- `agent_id`: Unique agent identifier
- `activity_type`: Type of activity (thinking, speaking, tool_use, meeting, idle)
- `message`: Activity description
- `status`: Agent status
- `timestamp`: When the activity occurred
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (JSON)

### Meetings Table
- `session_id`: Reference to session
- `meeting_id`: Unique meeting identifier
- `participants`: List of meeting participants (JSON)
- `topic`: Meeting topic
- `agenda`: Meeting agenda (JSON)
- `transcript`: Meeting transcript (JSON)
- `outcomes`: Meeting outcomes (JSON)
- `timestamp`: When the meeting occurred
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (JSON)

### Metrics Table
- `session_id`: Reference to session (optional)
- `cpu_usage`: CPU usage percentage
- `memory_usage`: Memory usage percentage
- `active_agents`: Number of active agents
- `timestamp`: When the metrics were recorded

## Usage

### Starting the App
When you start the web interface, it will:
1. Initialize the database with proper schema
2. Load all historical data from previous sessions
3. Display active sessions that can be resumed
4. Show recent chat logs and agent activity

### During Research
All data is automatically persisted:
- Chat messages are saved immediately
- Agent activities are recorded in real-time
- Meetings are stored with full details
- System metrics are tracked continuously

### After Restart
When you restart the app:
1. All previous sessions are loaded
2. Chat logs are restored
3. Agent activity history is available
4. Meeting records are preserved
5. You can continue from where you left off

## Data Location

The persistent data is stored in:
- **Database**: `~/.ai_research_lab/data/research_sessions.db`
- **Backups**: `~/.ai_research_lab/backups/`
- **Archives**: `~/.ai_research_lab/archives/`
- **Logs**: `~/.ai_research_lab/logs/`

## API Endpoints

### Data Retrieval
- `GET /api/data/history` - Get historical data for app startup
- `GET /api/sessions` - Get all research sessions
- `GET /api/sessions/<session_id>` - Get specific session details
- `GET /api/chat-logs` - Get chat logs with filtering
- `GET /api/agent-activity` - Get agent activity with filtering
- `GET /api/meetings` - Get meetings with filtering
- `GET /api/metrics` - Get system metrics

### Data Persistence
- `POST /api/chat-logs` - Add new chat log entry
- `POST /api/agent-activity` - Add new agent activity
- `POST /api/meetings` - Add new meeting record

## Testing

Run the test script to verify persistent storage:
```bash
cd web_ui
python3 test_persistence.py
```

This will:
1. Create test data in all tables
2. Verify data persistence
3. Test data retrieval
4. Confirm session continuity

## Migration

The system automatically handles database schema migrations. If new columns are added, they will be created automatically without data loss.

## Backup and Recovery

While the focus is on persistent storage, backup functionality is still available:
- `POST /api/data/backup` - Create database backup
- `POST /api/data/restore` - Restore from backup
- `POST /api/data/export` - Export data to archive
- `POST /api/data/import` - Import data from archive

## Benefits

1. **No Data Loss**: All interactions are preserved
2. **Session Continuity**: Resume research from where you left off
3. **Historical Analysis**: Review previous research sessions
4. **Reliability**: Data persists across app restarts and crashes
5. **Performance**: Fast local database access
6. **Scalability**: Efficient indexing and querying

## Future Enhancements

- Data compression for large datasets
- Advanced search and filtering
- Data export in multiple formats
- Cloud synchronization (optional)
- Data analytics and insights
