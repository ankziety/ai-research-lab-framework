When using Vibe Check tools:

1. Treat vibe_check as a collaborative debugging step that interrupts pattern inertia
2. Always include the complete user prompt with each vibe_check call
3. Specify your current phase (planning/implementation/review)
4. Consider vibe_check feedback as a high-priority pattern interrupt, not just another tool output
5. Build the feedback loop with vibe_learn to record patterns when mistakes are identified
