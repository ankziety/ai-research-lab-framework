# Virtual Lab Integration - Agent Session

## Session Information
- **Agent**: Scientific Computing Engineer
- **Date**: 2025-01-18
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Virtual Lab Meeting System Integration
- **Session ID**: VL_INTEGRATION_001

## Mission Context
Integrate the proven meeting-based research methodology from the Virtual Lab repository (`https://github.com/zou-group/virtual-lab`) into the existing AI research lab framework. This is the absolute first priority to enhance the meeting system with the battle-tested approach from the Nature paper.

## Analysis Completed
- [x] Virtual Lab repository cloned and analyzed
- [x] Core components identified: Agent system, Meeting system, Prompt system, Constants, Utilities
- [x] Architecture comparison completed
- [x] Integration strategy defined
- [x] Component mapping established

## Integration Strategy
**Approach**: Conservative enhancement preserving current structure while integrating Virtual Lab's proven meeting methodology

**Key Integration Points**:
1. **Core Meeting System**: Replace `_conduct_team_meeting()` and `_conduct_individual_meeting()` with Virtual Lab methodology
2. **Agent Enhancement**: Merge Virtual Lab agent properties with current BaseAgent system
3. **Tool Integration**: Add PubMed search and token tracking capabilities
4. **Persistence Enhancement**: Add JSON/Markdown discussion saving
