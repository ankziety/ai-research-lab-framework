# AI Research Lab Framework

This repository contains a modular framework to support the orchestration of AI builder agents for research projects. It provides scaffolding and utilities for memory storage, literature retrieval, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting.

## Structure

- `agents/` – definitions of builder agents and orchestrators.
- `memory/` – vector memory implementation using FAISS + SQLite stub.
- `sessions/` – session management and state persistence.
- `manuscripts/` – manuscript drafts generated by the system.
- `experiments/` – experiment definitions and results.
- `tests/` – unit and integration tests.
- `project_manager/` – logs and orchestration utilities.

## Workflow

1. Build core modules on feature branches.
2. Use the project manager to spawn builder agents.
3. Merge feature branches into `dev` after tests pass.
4. Merge `dev` into `main` for stable releases.
